# Credit Risk Analysis Using Bayesian Networks

## Overview
This project explores the use of **Bayesian Networks** to predict credit default risk. By leveraging probabilistic graphical models, we aim to provide insights into the relationships between key financial and demographic factors affecting credit behavior. The approach combines data-driven insights with interpretable probabilistic modeling, offering a robust alternative to traditional black-box machine learning models.

## Features
- **Probabilistic Modeling:** Implemented a Bayesian Network using structure learning methods like Hill Climb Search.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes feature engineering, discretization, and advanced feature selection techniques.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compared Bayesian Networks with models such as XGBoost on key performance metrics (e.g., ROC-AUC, F1 Score).
- **Explainability:** Visualized conditional dependencies and key drivers of credit default using graphical models.

## Key Components
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Cleaned and preprocessed raw financial and demographic data.
   - Engineered and discretized features for Bayesian Network compatibility.

2. **Modeling**
   - Applied structure learning techniques (Hill Climb Search, Maximum Likelihood Estimation).
   - Built and optimized a Bayesian Network to capture probabilistic dependencies.

3. **Evaluation**
   - Compared Bayesian Network performance against XGBoost using metrics like:
     - ROC-AUC
     - F1 Score
     - Confusion Matrix

4. **Visualization**
   - Generated dependency graphs to illustrate relationships between variables.
   - Created performance plots and evaluation charts.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary language for implementation.
- **pgmpy**: Library for building and analyzing Bayesian Networks.
- **pandas, numpy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: Feature selection and performance evaluation.
- **XGBoost**: Benchmarking against Bayesian Network.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data visualization.

## Results
- Achieved strong predictive performance, balancing accuracy and interpretability.
- Demonstrated the Bayesian Networkâ€™s capability to model relationships and dependencies.
- Provided an interpretable model alternative for credit default prediction.
